# Confluence Integration Rule

Whenever the project is specified in a conversation with the user, it is strongly recommended to use the available tools to retrieve additional information about the project from the Confluence space accessible via tools.

These tools will provide additional information about the current project that you are working on, such as its tech stack, versions, integrations, use cases, etc.
